  "abstract": "We study who becomes a lobbyist in the US and Germany. Merging 52,496 federal lobbyists with 200M+ LinkedIn users, we describe connections and expertise, use ML to predict selection, and DiD to estimate effects of political connections. Skills and connections both predict selection; skills matter more than connections.",
