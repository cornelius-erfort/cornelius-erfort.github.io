(Updated from 2017 to 2021 counties)

This repository provides historic, comparable county-level election results for West Germany since 1953. These can be easily merged with other historic data on the county level using offical county ID numbers (AGS, Allgemeiner Gemeindeschlüssel) that are also provided. The final dataset contains estimates for the vote share of all major parties for each election from 1953-2021 (within the boundaries of the 2021 counties) obtained from areal weighted interpolation.
