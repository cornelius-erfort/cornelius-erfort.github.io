I am a doctoral researcher at the cluster of excellence SCRIPTS and a PhD candidate at HU Berlin.

My main interests are in comparative politics and quantitative methods. More specifically, I focus on the political behavior of candidates, representatives and political parties in the face of changing demographics and new technology using quantitative social science methods. In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), I analyze how parties’ use the targeting capabilities of social media advertising.

I completed my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-Universität, spent a semester at the CIDE in Mexico City and have a background in mechanical engineering.
