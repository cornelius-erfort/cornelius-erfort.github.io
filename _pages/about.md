I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics/about) graduate school which is jointly organized by [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). I previously worked at the cluster of excellence [SCRIPTS](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/).

My main interests are in comparative politics and quantitative methods. More specifically, I focus on the political behavior of candidates, representatives and political parties in the face of changing demographics and new technology using quantitative social science methods. In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), I analyze how parties’ use the targeting capabilities of social media advertising.

I completed my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-Universität, spent a semester at the CIDE in Mexico City and have a background in mechanical engineering.

On this website, you can find more information on my research projects and download my [CV](/cv).

                                        <p>This letter investigates how voter transitions between parties affect parties’ policy positioning. While a growing literature investigates the role of election results as signals for parties’ policy adaption, it has mostly focused on vote changes of individual parties. However, parties do not know only whether they have won or lost in an election; they also have detailed information on which parties they won votes from and which parties they lost votes to. We make two arguments about how voter transitions should affect the strategic policy choices of political parties. First, when a party has lost votes to another party it will adapt its policy positions toward that party. Second, parties that have overall lost more votes become more likely to adapt their positions. Making use of a data set on individual voter transitions and party positions we can demonstrate that voter transitions indeed affect parties’ competitive behavior.</p>
