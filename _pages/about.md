I am a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about-dynamics/about) graduate school which is jointly organized by [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). I previously worked at the cluster of excellence [SCRIPTS](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/).

My main interests are in comparative politics and quantitative methods. More specifically, I focus on the political behavior of candidates, representatives and political parties in the face of changing demographics and new technology using quantitative social science methods. In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), I analyze how parties’ use the targeting capabilities of social media advertising.

I completed my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-Universität, spent a semester at the CIDE in Mexico City and have a background in mechanical engineering.

On this website, you can find more information on my research projects and download my [CV](/cv).
